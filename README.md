# I'm Hangry

## Description:

Deciding on what to eat when one is hungry can sometimes prove to be a tedious task.  To help undecided hungry eaters pick something to eat out of a list of food choices. This webpage solves the problem of not being able to deide on what to eat when one is hungry by letting the user choose from a list of cuisines which are put into a shuffled deck of cards to select from. Through this project we learned the implementaion of third party APIs. From finding which one works to how to intigrate it to our project and have it make the correct calls was the main focus of this project. The shuffled cards that were made to help randomly select the cuisine to eat was a feature that we challenged ourselves with becasue it was something we did not learn a lot about in class.
