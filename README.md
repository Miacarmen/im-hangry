# I'm Hangry

## Description:
What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 

    Motivation: Deciding on what to eat when one is hungry can sometimes prove to be a tedious task.
    
    Why: To help undecided hungry eaters pick something to eat out of a list of food choices

    Solves: This solves the problem of not being able to deide on what to eat when one is hungry by letting the user choose from a list of cuisine which is put into a wheel that will spin and randomly select a food option. Once the wheel stops spinning, then a page with recipes will load.

    What did we learn: Through this project we learned the implementaion of third party APIs. From finding which one works to how to intigrate it to our project and have it make the correct calls was the main focus of this project. 

    What stands out: The wheel that was made to help randomly select the cuisine to eat was a feature that we challenged ourselves with becasue it was something we did not learn a lot about in class.
